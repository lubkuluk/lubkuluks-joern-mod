The DLC is required for this mod to funciton. This mod is not recommended for a first playthrough. **Manlea and Ninja skins should remain disabled if you are playing as a character other than Lea**. Mod only contains text for English.

>**Note:** I'm usually active on the discord server, tune in to be able to see upcoming content or ask me questions

# **Mod Content:**
1. Playable Quadroguards with many combat arts (Around 50% done)
2. A very WIP Starcaller Character that focuses on summoning (Around 5% done)
3. Updated Joern movesets
4. Many reworked PvP battles with optional 2v2 PvP battles for a new experience
5. Unique PvP enemy AIs to fight against AND alongside with

>**Note:** All mod content is optional and can be ignored in the main story. You can still play as Lea and just experience the modded content as her. The mod can also be loaded up on your existing save files if you want instant access to the duels and all the combat arts. While difficult, It is also possible to fully complete the game as one of the modded characters. You can change characters at any time throughout the game as many times as you like. Skill tree, inventory, and progress will not be affected by changing characters.

## **Mod Info:**
1. LPC adds a number of playable characters, Quadroguard ones can always be freely changed at Info Hub (Rookie Harbor)
2. It's suggested that you use Char-Select mod to access other playable characters added to this mod
3. I sometimes forget to update Joern but Joern2 is always up-to-date
